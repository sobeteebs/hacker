			i came into info101 unsure what i was going to be learning about. i was very surprised and happy to find out that i was going to be learning how to code and develop web content. my favourite parts during lectures have been learning about the evolution of IT and the importance of cyber security in the 21st century. the workshops have most definitely been the highlight of taking info101 as i love the practical and hands on approach. <br> the first part of this portfolio i was unsure what to do as i didn't think it was a very clear brief. i also feel this way about the final portfolio assessment. this is because there is no mention of having to even write a reflection/experience page, and yet all of my classmates are doing this, as well as writing and sourcing bibliographies. while i have enjoyed this course a lot, i think it would be good to have more succinct briefs.
